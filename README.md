## Linked list implementation in Java with a single sentinel.

Unlike the usual implementations of Doubly Linked Lists in Java with "head" and "tail" or 2 sentinels, this one uses just a single sentinel so that the "head" is sentinel's next node and "tail" is its previous element. So, this list forms a "circle" of links.
